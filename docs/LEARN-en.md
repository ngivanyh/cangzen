# Learning Cangjie

## Preface
To learn Cangjie, you must learn two things: the **positions of each key** (like in every other input method), and the **decomposition of every Chinese characters** (note that **Traditional** Chinese knowledge is needed).

## Memorizing the Layout
Using `changjie`'s layout mode, (the one with the virtual keyboard on your screen) you can practice memorizing the layout, remember to refrain from looking at the on-screen keyboard as little as possible!

## Decomposition
The Canjie input method works by decomposing every Traditional Chinese character and mapping them to a type of stroke by the style of it. This is why **Traditional** Chinese knowledge is a requirement, as it bases on the handwriting of this type of Chinese characters. Using the decomposition mode, you can practice that, but you may want to consider looking at what keys correspond to what strokes, here is a resource that may be useful: [RESOURCE 1]((https://facaiy.com/assets/input_method/%E7%86%9F%E8%AE%B0%E5%B7%A7%E8%83%8C_%E5%80%89%E9%A0%A1%E8%BC%B8%E5%85%A5%E6%B3%95.pdf)).

If you can't read Chinese don't worry, just look at the first page, and you'll see the Cangjie key with a example of where it's used highlighted by red.
